Acute compression fracture of L4.\\n\\nProcedure:  Full Medicare maximum sterile barrier technique maintained throughout procedure. Prophylactic antibiotics included Ancef 2 g IV. General anesthesia provided by the anesthesia department.  Then, patient was transferred to fluoroscopy table in the prone position.  \\n\\nThen under fluoroscopic needle guidance we advanced 11-gauge needles through the right pedicle into L4 vertebral body.  Then we advanced the midline osteotome through pedicle access needle to create cavities for vertebral augmentation.  Then we proceeded with vertebral augmentation, advancing the Stryker curved delivery needles through pedicle needle into the inferior aspect vertebral body. Then we administered methyl methacrylate through each of the curve delivery needle under continuous fluoroscopic visualization.   We delivered a total of 9 cc cement which distributed throughout L4 vertebral body. Then, conventional manual compression was applied.  \\n\\nNo immediate complications.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.\\n\\nFluoroscopy time 9.0 minutes, following radiation goals as low as reasonably possible to perform safe procedure, necessary to carefully complete diagnostic and interventional procedure successfully. ALARA Utilization:  Dose reduction technique was used including one or more of the following: automated exposure control, iterative reconstruction technique, adjustment of mA and kV according to patient size and/or scan done according to ALARA (exposure dose as low as reasonably achievable)\\nTotal number of fluoroscopic images 133 images\\nTotal DAP: 2063.5 uGym*2\\n\\nImpression:\\n1.
