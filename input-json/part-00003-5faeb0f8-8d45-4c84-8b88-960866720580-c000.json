Large area of chronic infarct, left frontal parietal lobes with encephalomalacia and gliosis, stable appearance. 2. Mild cerebral atrophy, mainly frontal lobes. 3. Minimal diffuse white matter gliosis.\\r\\nTYPE OF STUDY:  CT HEAD WO CONTRAST INDICATION:  Suspected stroke DISCUSSION:  Multiple CT images through the head were performed. This is compared to prior CT of July 2013. There is mild to moderate cerebral atrophy. A large area of gliosis is seen in the left frontoparietal region. This is similar to the prior exam and represents chronic infarct. New areas of ischemia may not show up for over 24 hours by CT. MRI could be done as clinically indicated. [CT individualized dose optimization technique was used to include one or more of the following techniques: automated exposure control, mA and /or kV dose modulation according to patient size, and/or iterative reconstructive technique.] [MIP technique was done for 2D and/or 3D rendering.]\\r\\n\\r\\nElectronically Signed By: Rodriguez, Paul\\r\\nSigned Date: 07/12/2020 2:54 PM CDT)"}
